# monCTO
It is final version for the test of monCTO. 

#
I use HTML and CSS to design and build the structure of the website(main 3 surfaces), use NODE.JS as the back-end which provide the server, use PHP to connect front-end and back-end ,use php admin as server , and use mySQL as database.
Now,data uploaded from administrator surface can be stored in database, then we get the information from database and display these data on client surface.

#
But there is problem I did not solve, the programing does not have a dynamic progress to upload information from administrator surface to client surface. It means now I can upload the corresponding data from administrator surface to database,but it will not display on client surface automatically. 



# surfaces
1)Login surface: 
In the right half page, there are two buttons which provide different directions to clients and administrators. As for left half page, there are some simple introduction of monCTO and little guide for users.

2)Client surface: 
In sidebar, there are detailed information about each project(start time / planned time etc...) and a return link button. In middle, added projects will be displayed here ,clients can scroll the page to check more projects. In every demo, there are two links to help clients to reply for this project or get more information.

3)Administrator surface: 
Here, as an administrator, we can upload a whole project which consist of title/start time/finish time/planned time/description, and also we can upload related files and photos to show project clearly. click submit button to upload click return button to return to login surface


# MVC structure can be shown in seperate folders.
